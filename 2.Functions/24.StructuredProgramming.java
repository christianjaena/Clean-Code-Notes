/**
	STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING
*/

// Dijkstra's rule of structured programming.
// Every function, and every block within a function, should have one entry and one exit.
// This means that there should only be one return statement in a function, no break or continue statements in a loop, and never, ever, any goto statements.
// This is called: Single Entry - Single Exit Rule

// FUNCTIONS: VERBS
// CLASSES: NOUNS

// GOAL: Tell the story of the system, and that the functions you write need to fit cleanly together into a clear and precise language to help you with that telling.
