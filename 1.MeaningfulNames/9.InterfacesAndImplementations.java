/**
	INTERFACES AND IMPLEMENTATION
*/

// Common naming practice of Interfaces or prefixed with 'I' and the Implementation without prefix.
class IShapeFactory {}
class ShapeFactory {} // Implementation

// This depends on the company style of naming but it's preferred to prefix the Implementation class instead.
class ShapeFactory {} // Interface
class ShapeFactoryImp {}
