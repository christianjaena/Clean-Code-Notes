/**
	DON'T ADD GRATUITOUS CONTEXT
*/


// In an app, don't prefix every class by its abbreviation.

// For example, a Todo List app, don't name every class with prefixed "TDL<class>"

// Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear.
// Add no more context to a name than is necessary.

// PRECISION IN NAMING IS KEY
